# Project 3: Around The U.S.

In this project we work with a Figma design that provides layouts for mobile (320px) and desktop (1280px). The webpage we create is responsive with the width of the content area and changes depending on the width of the browser window, all while not having any horizontal scrolling.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma — we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
