# Project 8: Around The U.S.

In this project, we continue refactoring. We create a few more classes and couple them together. At the end of the project, we've set up project bundling and building with Webpack.

### Overview

**Intro**

Add the Section, Popup, PopupWithForm, PopupWithImages, and UserInfo classes to your project. Each class should perform one specific task. All logic related to a specific task must be encapsulated in its respective class.
If you need to combine any classes, do it using loose coupling. See Lesson 5 for details.
All classes have to be stored in separate files.
The index.js file must contain only the code for creating class instances and adding specific event listeners, and all such code should only be placed in index.js.
